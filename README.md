## FallWord

FallWord is a quiz based game where you have to guess the correct answers to questions. The answer can be a phrase, a word, or just a letter. We hate vowels here hence we show all the vowels in the answer right at the start!

## How to play?

> Make sure you have an an active reddit account before playing!

Head over to the [game subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallword_game/) and participate in the current month's game post. Here's how the game works:
FallWord has two game modes - SinglePlayer and Multiplayer.

- In singleplayer mode, you will be presented with a random question based on your chosen difficulty level. Your task is to guess the correct answer/word/phrase (within the time limit, if the timer is enabled). Difficulty levels - easy, medium, hard. Time, 60 seconds.
- In multiplayer mode, you will be paired with another online player. You and your opponent will have to climb through 5 levels of questions. The levels descriptions are as follows: - Level 1: Easy, 60 seconds - Level 2: Easy, 60 seconds - Level 3: Medium, 45 seconds - Level 4: Medium, 45 seconds - Level 5: Hard, 30 seconds

After each level, based on whether you guessed the answer correctly or not, you will get a score (+1 for correct, 0 for wrong and timeout). All 5 levels will be played irrespective of whether you win or lose. After the game ends, you and your opponent scores will be tallied up. Person with the highest score and with the lowest time taken will win.

Singleplayer and Multiplayer leaderboard will be updated after every singleplayer or multiplayer game. Incase, the leaderboard doesn't reflect the last game score, please refresh the page.
